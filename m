The receiving interface might have used GRO to receive more fragments than
MAX_SKB_FRAGS fragments. In this case, these will not be stored in
skb_shinfo(skb)->frags but merged into the frag list.

batman-adv relies on the function skb_split to split packets up into
multiple smaller packets which are not larger than the MTU on the outgoing
interface. But this function cannot handle frag_list entries and is only
operating on skb_shinfo(skb)->frags. If it is then still trying to split
such an skb and xmit'ing it on an interface without support for
NETIF_F_FRAGLIST then validate_xmit_skb() will try to linearize it. But
this fails due to inconsistent information and __pskb_pull_tail will
trigger a BUG_ON after skb_copy_bits() returns an error.

In case of entries in frag_list, just linearize the skb before operating on
it with skb_split().
